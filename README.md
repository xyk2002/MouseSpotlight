# MouseSpotlight
基于PyQT6
这是一个在Windows上用于寻找鼠标位置的应用，通过两次连续快速按下Ctrl键来启动模拟灯光聚焦的方式以凸显鼠标光标的位置。

制作这个的初衷是想要实现寻找鼠标的位置但是微软的Power Toys功能过于庞大，我只想只用他的这一个功能所以进行了复刻实现

Based on PyQT6
This is an application used on Windows to find the position of the mouse. By pressing the Ctrl key twice in a row quickly, a simulated light focusing method is activated to highlight the position of the mouse cursor.

The original intention of making this was to achieve the purpose of finding the position of the mouse. However, the function of Microsoft's Power Toys is too large. I only wanted to use this one function of his, so I carried out a replication and implementation
